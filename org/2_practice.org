* C Programming with OneCompiler
** Objective

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce students to
writing, compiling, and running simple C programs using
OneCompiler.com.

This is important so that you can complete your assignments & follow
along with me in class while coding ("code along") if you wish.

** Getting Started with OneCompiler

1. Open your web browser and go to https://onecompiler.com/c
2. Click on "New Program" and select "C" as the programming language.
3. You will see a default template with a simple C program.

** Creating a new C file in OneCompiler 

OneCompiler has two organisational levels: 1) code, 2) file, and we'll
change them both.

1. Delete the existing code to start with your own program.
2. Click on the pen in the middle of the page to change the name of
   the code to ="Hello World"= and add a short description:
   #+begin_quote
   First program with OneCompiler. CSC 100 class practice: 01/17/2025.
   #+end_quote
3. Add the tag =helloworld=. Tags help greatly with search + find.
4. Check the =Visibility=, change it to =Unlisted (People with the Link)=,
   and click on =Save=.
5. Open the main menu (three horizontal lines, upper left side) and
   choose =My Account=.
6. Click on =CODES=. You should see the last code you edited. If you use
   dark mode (button at top of the page), you won't see the tag. In
   the settings (three dots) you can change the visibility or delete
   the code.
7. Click on the name of your code to get back to the editor view.
8. Hovering over the filename =NewFile1.c=, find the edit pen: In the
   popup, enter a new file name: =helloworld.c=.
9. To clean the slate, open the settings (three dots) and choose
   =Clear Output=. You can also download your file from here.
10. Open the setting again, and choose =Editor Settings=. In the popup,
    check =Disable Code Autocomplete/Suggestions=.
   
** Basic Structure of a C Program

Every C program has a basic structure:

- Header information (/preprocessor/)
- =main= program ending with =return 0;=
- Program body enclosed in ={ }=
- Comments (optional) followed by =//=

#+begin_src C
  #include <stdio.h> 


  int main() { 
    puts("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
  } 
#+end_src

Your task:
1. Type the program (with comments) into the editor.
2. At the end of each line, press =Enter=.
3. At the start of a new line, press =TAB= to indent
4. The file is automatically saved.
5. Click =RUN= (or =CTRL + ENTER)= and check the =Output= field.

** Downloading and uploading files

1) Add a program header. Adapt the header below to your own program:
   #+begin_example
   /*****************************************/
   /* helloworld.c: Print greeting string   */
   /* Input: none                           */
   /* Output: Hello, world!                  */                     
   /* Author: Marcus Birkenkrahe            */
   /* Date: 1/4/2025                        */
   /*****************************************/
   #+end_example

2) After making sure that the program (still) produces the desired
   output, =Download= it to your PC using the settings menu (three dots)
   as =helloworld.c=.

3) Open Canvas and find the =Getting started with OneCompiler=
   assignment.

4) Upload the =helloworld.c= file.
 
5) Upload the link (URL) to the online file. You find it in the status
   bar of your browser. Mine is: https://onecompiler.com/c/43546aswu

** Extensions

- Below the editor, there is extensive Syntax help for C programming,
  check it out. You can also get to this with the =How to (Wiki)=
  selection in the settings.

- OneCompiler offers a nice free [[https://onecompiler.com/tutorials/c][C tutorial]] if you want to work
  ahead. You find it in the top menu (three horizontal lines).

- There are programming [[https://onecompiler.com/challenges][challenges]] (some of which we'll be doing in
  and outside of class). You have to pick your language.

- There are [[https://onecompiler.com/cheatsheets][cheatsheets]], as a useful reference or a condensed overview
  of an advanced topic - check out =C++ Programming language=.

- Next time you want to get back straight to the C editor, go to
  =onecompiler.com/c=.
