   #+end_quote

5. What sits at the heart of the computer and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   At the heart of the computer sits the kernel program juggling
   thousands of system and user processes simultaneously while
   maintaining the illusion (for you) that it is only there for you.
   #+end_quote

6. How will you be evaluated in this class?

- [X] C Programming language
- [X] Online programming platforms
- [X] Compiling with onecompiler.com
- [X] Uploading an in-class assignment
- [X] Assignments for next week

** Review/Test preview (Way of the Program)

- The review questions are related to one or more questions on the
  weekly tests. In this case they come from the chapter you just read.

-----

1. What's the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?
   Examples for such languages?
   #+begin_comment
   /Interpreted/ languages (like Python) go straight from /source code/ to
   result, while /compiled/ languages (like C++) require an intermediate
   step, machine or /object/ code, before they can be run.
   #+end_comment

2. Who does what with what until a C program can be run?
   #+begin_comment
   1) The /user/ write /source code/ in an /editor/.
   2) The user saves the source code in a =.c= file.
   3) The /compiler/ translates the =.c= file into object code (=a.out=)
   4) The /shell/ executes the program.
   #+end_comment

3. What is the anatomy (dissection) of this command: =printf("Hello\n");=
   #+begin_comment
   1) =printf= is a function defined in the =<stdio.h>= header file.
   2) The function argument is a string ="..."=.
   3) The string consists of a /string literal/ (constant) =Hello= and a
   new line character, =\n=.
   4) The command is delimited by a =;= character.
   #+end_comment

4. Which programming errors do you know, when do they occur, and do
   you have an example?
   #+begin_comment
   1) /Syntax errors/ when the language rules are violated, for example
   a missing semicolon - program will not compile.
   2) /Logical errors/ when your algorithm does not work, for example
   the wrong formula - program will not crash.
   3) /Run-time errors/ when the program is executed - for example when
   you divide by zero - program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
   4) /Semantic error/ when program compiles and runs but produces
   incorrect results due to incorrect meaning - for example, using
   a variable incorrectly.

   *Exercise: write little programs that produce each of these errors.*
   #+end_comment

5. Explain the structure of a typical C program.
   #+begin_src C
     // preprocessing: include header files for input/output
     #include <stdio.h>

     // main program:
     int main(void)
     {
       // action
       puts("Hello");
       // confirm success
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

6. What is "parsing"?
   #+begin_comment
   Analyzing the structure of a program - e.g. finding =main= to mark
   the beginning of the program, or =printf= to begin printing.
   #+end_comment

7. Does C code have to be indented like this to work?
   #+begin_src C
     int main()
     {
       float pi = 3.14;
       printf("%.2f",pi);
     }
   #+end_src

8. Do you always have to have a =main= program?
   #+begin_comment
   Yes.
   #+end_comment

9. What's debugging?
   #+begin_center
   Finding and fixing programming mistakes. Helpful: using a debugging
   program like =gdb= ("GNU Debugger") that allows you to step through
   the code to print intermediate results.
   #+end_center

10. Which program translates human-readable source code into
    machine-executable object code?
    #+begin_center
    =gcc= - the GNU C Compiler.
    #+end_center

** Assignments of the week

1. Complete a simple extension of the "hello world" program: Comment
   every line of the program and upload the URL to Canvas (Monday)

2. Read the second chapter (Variables and Types): 8 pages (you'll be
   tested on the content in test 2 at the end of the week - Friday).

3. There are two bonus assignments, which you can tackle at any point
   between now and May 9 (last day of class). One is simple, the other
   one is not so simple.

* Week 3: Printing formatted values & Variables
#+attr_html: :width 600px:

- [X] Results: Test 1 & missing in action
- [X] P/review: Introduction
- [X] Practice: Printing formatted values in C
- [X] Lecture: Variables & Types

** Test 1 results and MIA

#+attr_html: :width 450px:
[[../img/t1_hist.png]]

- Four students missed the deadline!? (->  Max 50%)

- Good, almost excellent average! (89.44%)

- Code to draw the diagram shown (6 lines in R):
  #+begin_example R
  ## Variables
  t1 <- c(15,18,18,24,25,26,rep(27,3),rep(28,4),rep(29,5),rep(30,6))
  t1_normal <- t1/30 * 100
  t1_mean = mean(t1_normal)
  t1_mean_fmt <- as.numeric(format(t1_mean,digits=4))
  ## Plot
  hist(t1_normal,
       main="CSC 100: Test 1 (N=24)",
       xlab="Percentage",
       ylab="Number of participants",
       col="mistyrose")
  abline(v=mean(t1_mean),lwd=3,col="red")
  ## Legend
  legend("top",
         legend=paste("Average:",t1_mean_fmt,"%"),
         lty=1,lwd=3,
         col="red")
  #+end_example

** Review/Test preview: Introduction

1. What are the current assignments? How can you find out?
   #+attr_html: :width 700px:
   [[../img/calendar.png]]

   - The next assignment is test 2 (Friday, 31 January, 9 am).

   - The test is based on chapter 2 of the handout (Think C).

   - The next programming assignment is also due on Friday.

2. Which language has more rules and more words - C or English?
   #+begin_quote
   C has hundreds of clear rules collected in a few hundred pages of
   documentation, and only 30 reserved words.

   English has thousands of constantly evolving rules of grammar,
   spelling, pronunciation, and style, and hundreds of thousands of
   words.
   #+end_quote

3. What is =\n= called, and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   =\n= is an "escape character" that escapes the =n= using the =\=.

   When the machine sees =\n= it prints a new line.
   #+end_quote

4. When you type =main= in the editor, what does the machine see?
   #+begin_example
   The machine sees a sequence of ASCII characters that correspond to
   a binary stream (bits):

   m: ASCII code = 109, binary = 01101101
   a: ASCII code = 97, binary = 01100001
   i: ASCII code = 105, binary = 01101001
   n: ASCII code = 110, binary = 01101110
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C :results table
     printf("%c %c %c %c\n",'m','a','i','n');
     printf("%i %i %i %i\n",'m','a','i','n');
     printf("%b %b %b %b\n",'m','a','i','n');
   #+end_src

5. What are the three main elements of computer architecture?
   #+attr_html: :width 500px:
   #+Caption: Central Processing Unit, Random Access Memory, Non Volatile Memory
   [[../img/computer_architecture.png]]

6. What's the main problem of computer architecture?
   #+Caption: The CPU is super-fast, the RAM is fast, and the NVM is very slow
   #+attr_html: :width 500px:
   [[../img/computer_architecture2.png]]

7. What does "tokenizing" mean?
   #+begin_quote
   "Tokenizing" means breaking down a sequence of text into smaller
   units called "tokens". In programming, these are the smallest
   elements of the source code that have meaning, such as keywords
   (e.g. =main=, =printf=), operators (=+=, ===), and punctuation =(;, {)=.
   #+end_quote

8. What's an IDE?
   #+begin_quote
   IDE = Integrated Development Environment - an application that
   integrates the editor, the compiler, and the shell so that you can
   write, compile and execute programs without leaving the app.

   Example: Emacs + Org-mode, or Onecompiler.com.
   #+end_quote

9. What is pseudocode?
   #+begin_quote
   Code in prose that encodes only the program logic and the program
   flow, but that does not comply with the syntax rules of any
   programming languages. A flowchart is pseudocode with graphics.
   #+end_quote

10. What is "Syntax highlighting"?
    #+begin_quote
    Syntax highlighting shows programming language syntax elements in
    different colors and/or fonts. Very helpful for writing/debugging
    code.
    #+end_quote

11. What should your source code include?
    #+begin_quote
    A program header with program name, input, output, author, date
    and license information.
    #+end_quote

12. What happens  if you  assign a  string value  like "Hello"  to an
    integer variable?
    #+begin_src C :tangle ../src/test.c
      int x;
      x = "Hello";
    #+end_src
    #+begin_quote
    - You can try this best in pythontutor (unless you have Emacs).
    - I will show you both pythontutor and the manual way.
    #+end_quote

** Review - printing with =%s=

1. What is ="%s %s"= ?
   #+begin_quote
   Two format specifiers waiting for two string values, for example
   ="Hello"= and ="World"=.
   #+end_quote

2. What's the difference between =%s%s\n= and =%s %s \n= ?
   #+begin_quote
   =%s%s\n= prints two strings without a space followed by a new line.

   =%s %s \n= prints two strings with a space between them followed by a
   space followed by a new line.
   #+end_quote

3. How many ways are there to print two words on two lines?

   #+begin_quote
   Many. You saw at least three.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :results output :includes <stdio.h>
     // print with `puts` (newline included)
     puts("Hello,");
     puts("world!\n");
     // Print two strings, one call, newline in the format part
     printf("%s\n%s", "Hello,", "world!");
     // Print one string per call
     printf("\n\n%s", "Hello");
     printf("\n%s", "world");
     // Print one string, newline in the value part
     printf("\n\n%s", "Hello\nworld!");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_example
   Hello,
   world!

   Hello,
   world!

   Hello
   world

   Hello
   world!
   #+end_example

4. You want to print five numbers. How many format specifiers do you
   need?
   #+begin_quote
   Five - one for each number.
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_src C
     // Print five integer values
     printf("%i %i %i %i %i\n", 0, 1, 2, 3, 4);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 0 1 2 3 4

5. How many arguments does =printf= accept?
   #+begin_quote
   As many as it takes & as much memory as there is available.
   The general form is:
   printf( [format string], [arguments] );
   #+end_quote

** Test 1 deadline is this Friday (11:59 pm)!

- First results look promising!
- Take your merry time with the test!
- When asked about code, try it out!

** Assignment review: Hello world program with comments

- *Puzzled:* Many of you did not follow the instructions!? (AVG=8.76)

- *Note*: Instructions are everything, creativity means nothing.

- *Always ask* if you're unsure or confused. I'm here to help!

- *Review questions*:

  1) What does the program header contain?
     #+begin_quote
     Program name, purpose, input, output, author, pledge, date
     #+end_quote
  2) What does the function header contain?
     #+begin_quote
     Function name, return type, parameters (function arguments)
     #+end_quote
  3) What would the function header for this function look like?
     #+begin_example C
       void hello(char name) {
         printf("Hello, Mr. %c!", name);
       }
     #+end_example

     #+begin_src C :results output
       // hello: print a greeting and a character
       // returns: nothing (void)
       // parameters: character `name`
       void hello(char name) {
         printf("Hello, Mr. %c!", name);
       }
       int main(){
         hello('X');
         return 0;
       }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : Hello, Mr. X!
  4) What exactly happens in =printf("Hello, world.\n");=
     #+begin_example C
     // function `printf` is called
     // string "Hello, world." is printed
     // escape character `\n` moves cursor to next line
     // statement is closed with the delimiter `;`
     #+end_example
  5) Where should one put meta data like headers and comments?
     #+begin_quote
     - All meta data are placed ahead of what they're accompanying
     - Headers are placed immediately before functions
     - Comments =//= or =/* */= are placed immediately before or next to
       what they' commenting upon.
     #+end_quote

     #+begin_src C
       // hello: Print greeting
       // Returns: nothing (void)
       // Parameters: none (void)
       void hello(void) {
         puts("Hello.");
       }

       /*
        ,*   main program
        ,*/
       int main(void)
       {

         hello(); // call function

         return 0;
       }
     #+end_src

** Review (last lecture)

1. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     printf(%s\n, "Hello");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Hello

   #+begin_quote
   The format string =%s\n= is not formatted as a string.

   Syntax error. Correct: =printf("%s\n", "Hello");=
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C :results output
     puts("I am %i years old", 22);
     puts("I am 22 years old");
     printf("I am %i years old", 22);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : I am %i years old
   : I am 22 years old
   : I am 22 years old

   #+begin_quote
   The =puts= function only prints a string + a new line.

   Logic error. Correct: =puts("I am 22 years old");=
   #+end_quote

3. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C :tangle main.c :includes <stdio.h>
     void main()
     {
       puts("");
     }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:

   #+begin_quote
   The =main= function must =return= an =int=, not =void=.

   Run-time error. Correct: =int main() { puts(""); return 0;}=
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     printf("I have %c\n", "character.");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : I have 

   #+begin_quote
   A string argument is provided but a character argument is expected.

   Type mismatch error. Correct: =printf("I have %s\n", "character.");=
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C  :tangle main2.c :includes <stdio.h>
     printf("%i + %i = %i \n", 224);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 224 + 1768136904 = -1361404480

   #+begin_quote
   One integer argument is provided but three are expected.

   Run-time error. Correct: =printf("%i + %i = %i \n", 2, 2, 4);=
   #+end_quote

** Review of the last lecture

1. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     height = 10;
     int height;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   The variable =height= is used before it is declared.
   #+end_quote

2. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     int main(void) {
       int height;
       printf("The height is %d\n", height);
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   The variable =height= is uninitialized, so its value is undefined.
   #+end_quote

3. What's wrong with this code?
   #+begin_src C
     8 = height;
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   Literals like =8= cannot be assigned values because they are
   constants.
   #+end_quote

4. What's wrong with this multi-variable declaration/definition?
   #+begin_src C
     int height = 3, width = 2, volume
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   The statement is missing a semicolon (=;=).
   #+end_quote

5. What's wrong with this variable reassignment?
   #+begin_src C
     int main(void) {
       int foo;
       foo = 8;
       int foo = 18;
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src
   #+begin_quote
   A variable cannot be redeclared within the same scope.
   #+end_quote
