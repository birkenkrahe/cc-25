- [ ] Classroom situation (bring your laptop)
- [ ] Orientation - introduction to the course
- [ ] Introduction to the topic of the course

** DONE 30 students - 24 available PCs (at best)

- Bring your own laptop to class (best)
- Work on one PC with someone else (take turns)
- Work through the material using the recording


** TODO Review (Overview)

- When you hear the question, try to think of an answer.
- When you hear my answer(s), compare yours with mine.
- Sometimes my answers will contain additional information.
- Ask if anything is unclear this second time round.

1. What are the parts of our online programming environment?
   #+attr_html: :width 300px: 
   [[../img/onecompiler2.png]]

2. Which online platforms are we going to use (know at least 2):
   #+begin_quote
   1) Canvas (learning management system)
   2) GitHub (lectures)
   3) Google Drive (whiteboard)
   4) Google Space (discussion)
   5) OneCompiler (programming)
   #+end_quote

3. What is "pseudocode"?
   #+begin_quote
   Instructions without syntax rules.
   #+end_quote
   Example:
   #+begin_example
   Start the program
   Count to 10
   Print number
   End the program
   #+end_example
   #+attr_html: :width 400px:

4. What does a typical "computing infrastructure" include?
   #+begin_quote
   1) An Operating system (like Windows or Linux) to do anything.
   2) Files to save source files (like =hello.c=).
   3) A Shell (or command-line) like =bash= to pass commands to the OS
   4) An editor to write, debug and save source code files.
   5) A network (like the Internet) for cloud applications.
   #+end_quote

5. What sits at the heart of the computer and what does it do?
   #+begin_quote
   At the heart of the computer sits the kernel program juggling
   thousands of system and user processes simultaneously while
   maintaining the illusion (for you) that it is only there for you.
   #+end_quote

6. How will you be evaluated in this class?
   #+begin_quote
   1) 50% for your programming assignments.
   2) 25% for your tests.
   3) 25% for your final exam (optional).
   #+end_quote

7. How can you get help for this class?
   #+begin_quote
   1) Ask me during class.
   2) During office hours (tinyurl.com/sp25-booking).
   3) Post your question to the Google class chat.
   4) Check one of the free, online textbooks.
   5) Use AI and don't forget to credit it.
   6) Attend all classes and/or work through the recordings.

** TODO Review/Test preview (Introduction)

- The review questions are related to one or more questions on the
  weekly tests.
- You should ask yourself if you have an answer and then compare with
  my answer.
- It is worth going over these [p]review sections again to test your
  understanding and your knowledge.

-----

1. What's the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?
   Examples for such languages?
   #+begin_quote
   /Interpreted/ languages (like Python) go straight from /source code/ to
   result, while /compiled/ languages (like C) require an intermediate
   step, machine or /object/ code, before they can be run.
   #+end_quote

2. Who does what with what until a C program can be run?
   #+begin_quote
   1) The /user/ write /source code/ in an /editor/.
   2) The user saves the source code in a =.c= file.
   3) The /compiler/ translates the =.c= file into object code (=a.out=)
   4) The /shell/ executes the program.
   #+end_quote
  
3. What is the anatomy (dissection) of this command: =printf("Hello\n");=
   #+begin_quote
   1) =printf= is a function defined in the =<stdio.h>= header file.
   2) The function argument is a string ="..."=.
   3) The string consists of a /string literal/ (constant) =Hello= and a
      new line character, =\n=.
   4) The command is delimited by a =;= character.
   #+end_quote
  
4. Which programming errors do you know, when do they occur, and do
   you have an example?
   #+begin_quote
   1) /Syntax errors/ when the language rules are violated, for example
      a missing semicolon - program will not compile.
   2) /Logical errors/ when your algorithm does not work, for example
      the wrong formula - program will not crash.
   3) /Run-time errors/ when the program is executed - for example when
      you divide by zero - program crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
   4) /Semantic error/ when program compiles and runs but produces
      incorrect results due to incorrect meaning - for example, using
      a variable incorrectly.

   *Exercise: write little programs that produce each of these errors.*
   #+end_quote
  
5. Explain these commands: =gcc=, =gdb=, =cat=, =%%writefile=, =nano=, =ls=:
   #+begin_quote
   1) =gcc=: GNU C and C++ compiler.
   2) =gdb=: GNU debugger.
   3) =cat=: Unix viewing program.
   4) =nano=: GNU line editor.
   5) =ls=: List files.
   #+end_quote

6. Explain the structure of a typical C program.
